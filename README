Developmental Relaxometry Dataset
==============================

Content
-----------

This developmental relaxometry dataset consists of quantitative T1 and T2 maps of children aged between 3 and 18 years.
T1 and T2 maps were derived from MP2RAGE and GRAPPATINI acquisition protocols. Defaced nifti files of each participant
are available in bids format, along with their sex and age.

Derivatives include results from a normative analysis, were the linear change in relaxometry values with respect to age
was estimated for a set of brain regions, using an in-house software. Individual values for each region are available.
The slope, offset, and 95% prediction intervals for each region are summarised in an Excel table along with a sheet that
can be used to input measurements from new subjects, and evaluate if they fall within the model's predicted norm. We
also provide movies that illustrate how relaxometry values change with age (one frame every 0.1 years) in a selected set
of regions. Two nifti files with a lower sampling across age are also provided for users to visualize the whole volume
(one sample every 6 months).
